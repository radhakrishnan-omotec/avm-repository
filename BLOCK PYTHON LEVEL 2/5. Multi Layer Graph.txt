MULTI LAYER GRAPH

2
Learning Outcomes:

Remember: The students will recall about Coordinate System .
Understand: They will focus on understanding :
- Different types of graph
- Multi layer representation
- Data Handling
Apply: They will learn to apply the Library - pygal to generate graphs in the output .
Analyze: They will check their understanding by developing a code .

Create: They will create the code in EduBlocks

Remember & Understanding | [YI] U LTI-LAYER G RAPH

In Multilevel Graph, each layer of the graph is a subset of the original network (nodes and
intra-edges)
The inter-edges only connect the same nodes on different layers.
