Learning Outcomes:

Remember: The students will recall about the libraries learnt.

Understand: They will focus on understanding the Turtle Library and the Coordinate

system .
Apply: They will learn to apply Turtle Library for drawing shapes.
Analyze: They will check their understanding by developing a code .

Create: They will create the code in EduBlocks
Remember & Understanding TU RTLE BLOCK

@ “Turtle” is a Python feature like a drawing board, which lets us command a turtle to
draw all over it!

@ itis a pre-installed Python library that enables users to create pictures and shapes by
providing them with a virtual canvas.

@ The onscreen pen that you use for drawing is called the turtle and this is what gives the
library its name.

Turtle of the Python World!

Create fun drawings and shapes on your screen
with just some simple steps!

TURTLE METHOD

@ We can use functions like turtle.forward(...) and turtle.right(...) which can move
the turtle around. Commonly used turtle methods are :

Metis [Parmeter [esto

Creates and returns a new turtle

Turtle() None object

forward() amount eee by the
backward smount ee easels)
right() angle Turns the turtle clockwise

left) angle counterclockwise

TURTLE METHOD

Metiod  Leamete [esto

penup() None
pendown() None
up() None
down() None
color() Color name
fillcolor() Color name

Picks up the turtle’s Pen

Puts down the turtle’s Pen

Picks up the turtle’s Pen

Puts down the turtle’s Pen

Changes the color of the turtle’s pen

Changes the color of the turtle will
use to fill a polygon

TURTLE METHOD

Metiod  Leamete [esto

heading() None
position() None
goto() X,Y

begin_fill() None
end_fill() None
dot() None

Returns the current heading

Returns the current position

Move the turtle to position x,y

Remember the starting point fora
filled polygon

Close the polygon and fill with the
current fill color

Leave the dot at the current position

PLOTTING A TURTLE

Plotting using Turtle

oO

1@)

To make use of the turtle methods and

functionalities, we need to import turtle.

The 4 steps for executing a turtle

program is as follows:-

Import the turtle module
Create a turtle to control.

Draw around using the turtle
methods.

Run turtle.done().
