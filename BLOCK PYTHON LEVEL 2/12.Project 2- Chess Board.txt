TASK 01:-

</> WRITE A CODE TO CREATE A CHESS
BOARD

Import turtle library

set it to turtle

create a list of black and white
create 2 variables x,y

# Start code here

from turtle mport *

Use for loop in range of 8
use the pen up block

use goto block

create a variable “v”

use pen down block

e take a for loop
e give the if else condition

De

e Again repeat the for loop in range of
5

e take the if condition and later end
the fill.

ce:

rom turtle import * t.fillcolor(s[v])
() t.begin_fill{)
["White", "Black" ] for n

155 t. forward (44)
if n 4:
a (8): t. right (90)
penup() t-end_fill()
goto(-x,y)
