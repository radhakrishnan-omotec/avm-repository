Learning Outcomes:

Remember: The students will recall about the libraries learnt .

Understand: They will focus on understanding the use of a Processing Library .
Apply: They will learn to apply Processing Library for drawing shapes.

Analyze: They will check their understanding by developing a code .

Create: They will create the code in EduBlocks
PROCESSING IN PYTHON

Remember & Understanding

Processing is a free graphical library and integrated development environment (IDE)
built for the electronic arts, new media art, and visual design communities with the

purpose of teaching non-programmers the fundamentals of computer programming in

a visual context.

Processing uses the Java language, with additional simplifications such as additional

classes and aliased mathematical functions and operations. It also provides a

graphical user interface for simplifying the compilation and execution stage.

Remember & Understanding PROCESSING IN PYTHON

Used to set size of output screen.

Used to set background colour of output screen.

Used to run/process the created program.

On My Own TECHNOL

Used to set colour mode(BW/RGB).

Used to set Draw line. Takes 4 parameters(x,y,x1,y1)

al
PROCESSING IN PYTHON |

Used to draw circle/ellipse. Takes 4
parameters(x,y,width,height).

Used to fill shape with colour. Takes 3 parameters(r,g,b).
