TASK 01:-

</> WRITE A CODE TO CREATE A MEMORY
GAME

Import turtle library

set it to turtle

Take a while loop

create the variable a and ask the
user how many digits you want to
guess

Create the empty list

Take a for loop in range of 0, a

use the list method append to
generate random numbers from 0-9

# Start code here
import time

import random

while :

Cosa

|
random.randint( [0,9] ) |

e Print “Memories the number you
have only 5 sec”

eprint the list list *

time sleep of 5 sec to memorize

e use for loop in range of 0-30

Print enter number with the str

Use the if condition to check the list
and if this is it matches then print
correct doing well.

Or else print “wrong the sequence
was” and break the loop

for @ in range 0,0] ):

rite CORRECT, Doing well Ji)

fie WORNG, The sequence was |g)

break

for i in range(@,36):
print(™")
for i in range(@,a):
print(

in range(@,

print("enter number ™ + str(it1))

= int(input(""))

== [i]:
print("CORRECT, Doing well")

print("WORNG, The sequence was")

pr i nt (
