Learning Outcomes:

Remember: The students will recall about previous concepts - libraries .
Understand: They will focus on understanding more about Math Library , Floor
Division

Apply: They will learn to apply the Math and Time Library to build code for Digital
Timer.

Analyze: They will check their understanding by developing a code .

Create: They will create the code in EduBlocks

Remember & Understanding
