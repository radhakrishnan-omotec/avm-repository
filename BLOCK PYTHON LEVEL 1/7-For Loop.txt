SESSION - 7
FOR LOOP

Learning Outcomes:
●

Remember: The students will list different types of blocks being learnt in the session .

●

Understand: - They will focus on understanding the use and application of FOR Loop.

●

Apply: They will apply FOR Loop to work on different programs.

●

Analyze: They will check their understanding by developing a code.

●

Create: They will create the code in EduBlocks.

FOR LOOP

• A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a
dictionary, a set, or a string).
• This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works

more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming
languages.

• With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a
list, tuple, set etc.
• Example:for x in range(6):
print(x)

Apply & Create

TASK 01:</> WRITE A PROGRAM TO PRINT THE HELLO
WORLD 20 TIMES USING FOR LOOP

Program Step 1:-

Get a For Loop and set the range to 0,20

Program Step 2:-

Get print "Hello World" Block to print the name
multiple times

Output

Apply & Create

TASK 02:</>WRITE A PROGRAM TO PRINT HELLO
WORLD ALONG WITH THE INDEX 20 TIMES

Program Step 1:-

Get a For Loop and set the range to 0,20

Program Step 2:-

Get print "Hello World" Block to print the name
multiple times
