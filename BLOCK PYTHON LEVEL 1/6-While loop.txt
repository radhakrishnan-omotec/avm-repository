SESSION - 6
WHILE LOOP

Learning Outcomes:
●

Remember: The students will list different types of blocks being learnt in the session .

●

Understand: - They will focus on understanding the WHILE LOOP

●

Apply: They will apply While loop to build different codes

●

Analyze: They will check their understanding by developing a code of multiple programs.

●

Create: They will create the code in EduBlocks

Remember & Understanding

WHILE LOOP

• While Loop is mainly used to run the code for either unlimited times or
until the condition is matched
• For example if we want to make a code to print one number or a name for
100 time

Apply & Create

TASK 01:</> WRITE A PROGRAM TO PRINT THE NAME
USING WHILE LOOP

Program Step 1:-

Get a while loop from loops drawer

Program Step 2:-

Get print "Hello World" Block to print the name
multiple times

Output

Apply & Create

TASK 02:WRITE A PROGRAM WHERE A = 20 and B = 5 ,
PRINT A IS BIGGER UNTIL A BECOMES
LESSER THAN B AND DECREASE A EVERY
SECOND

Program Step 1:-

Create a variable with name 'A'

Program Step 2:-

Initialize the A variable

Program Step 3:-

The same way create another variable with
name 'B', and as mentioned in the question,
initialize A = 20 and B = 5

Program Step 4:Get print "Hello World" block and write "A is "
to show the value of A

Program Step 5:Get print variable block and write A on it to
print the value of variable A

Program Step 6:Follow the same procedure to print the value
of variable B

Program Step 7:-

Add a While loop to the code to make it run
multiple times

Program Step 8:-

Add a print "Hello World" block inside while
loop and print "A is bigger"

Program Step 9:-

Get a variable initialize block and change the
equals to into minus equals to, This means
whatever is the value of variable subtract
some number from it

Program Step 10:-

Add an if condition which will
compare the values of A and B

Program Step 11:-

Get a comparison block and change
it to less than equals to, to
compare the values

Program Step 12:-

Write A on the left side and B on
the right side on the comparison
block to compare if the value of A is
smaller or equals to B

Program Step 13:-

Add a print "Hello World" block
inside if condition so, If A == B,
Print Both are equal

Program Step 13:-
