SESSION - 1
INTRODUCTION
TO
PYTHON

Learning Outcomes:
● Remember: The students will list different types of blocks being learnt in the session .
● Understand: - They will be introduced to the Python Programming Language

- They will understand the use of Print command .
- They will also understand different data types .
● Apply: They will learn to apply and check the execution of the Print command.
● Analyze: They will check their understanding by developing a code.
● Create: They will create the code in EduBlocks

Introduction to EDUBLOCKS
EduBlocks is a visual block-based
programming tool that helps teachers
to introduce text-based programming
languages, like Python, to children at
an earlier age via a drag and drop
programming experience

The Interface
About the Interface :

1- Script Area - We write the
code here .
2- Code in the syntax format
will be displayed here .

3 - Block Area - We can
select and drag the required
blocks from this area
4- Click on the RUN Button
to execute the written code

Why Learn On EduBlocks ?
EduBlocks is the easiest way to make the transition from blocks to text, here's why:
❑

Text on the blocks: EduBlocks displays the Python text on the block so you can see exactly what you're coding.

❑

Python view: The main part of EduBlocks is the visual block editor but once you've completed your block code, you can
switch straight to a Python editor.

❑

EduBlocks has many different “modes" that can be used with external hardware or just in the browser. Modes include:

⮚

Python 3
BBC micro:bit
Raspberry Pi
CircuitPython

Print() Function
⮚ The print() function prints the specified message to the screen, or other standard output
device.
⮚ The message can be a string, or any other object, the object will be converted into a string
before written to the screen.

TASK 01:</>WRITE A PROGRAM TO PRINT YOUR NAME

Program

Connect print "Hello World" block and change
the text to “your name”

Program

Output

TASK 02:</>WRITE A PROGRAM TO PRINT YOUR NAME
AND MESSAGE WITH A DELAY FUNCTION

Delay Functions
➢ import time:- When we say import time, we're telling the computer to use a special tool
called "time" that helps us keep track of time. Just like you use a clock to know when it's
time for different activities, the computer uses the "time" tool to know how much time
has passed.

➢ time.sleep():-This function is like telling the robot to take a little break or pause for a
while. You can tell the robot to pause for a specific amount of time. For example, you
can say, "Robot, pause for 5 seconds." The robot will wait for 5 seconds before doing
the next thing you tell it to do.

Program Step 1:-

Add an time library from imports blocks

Program Step 2:-

Connect print "Hello World" block and change the text to “your name”

Program Step 3:-

Connect print “time.sleep()" block for delay 1 sec

Program Step 4:-

Connect print "Hello World" block and change the text to “message”

Program
