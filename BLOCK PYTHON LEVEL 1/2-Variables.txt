Remember & Understanding

DATA TYPES

Data types are like categories for information. Imagine you have a magic box, and this box
can hold different types of things. Data types help us know what kind of things can go into
the box.

Data Types

Numeric

Character

Logic

NUMERIC DATA TYPES
❑

Numeric –
⮚ only numeric numbers comes under this type 0 to 9
⮚ it covers all the numeric values including negative number

CHARACTER DATA TYPE
❑

Character or String⮚ All the alphabets A to Z, a to z and 0 to 9 including special characters comes in
this category.
⮚ Remember 0 to 9 in this category is different from numeric.
⮚ this data type is represented by “” or ‘’ example - “omotec”,

LOGICAL DATA TYPE
❑

Logical –
⮚ this type of variable only have 2 elements 0 and 1.
⮚ True and False

VARIABLES
• What is a variable?

Think of a variable as a box or a jar with a label on it. You can put things inside this box and
give it a name. The name is like the label on the jar, and it helps you remember what's inside.

• What can you put in a variable?

You can put different things in a variable. It could be a number, like how many candies you
have. It could be a word, like your name. It could even be a whole list of things, like your
favorite colors.

VARIABLES
Variable is a memory element in the programming. It is mainly used to store any value of any
data type.
⮚ It can Store only one value at a time
⮚ Value can be of any data type
⮚ A variable always have a name
⮚ Examples:
x=5
y = "John”

Apply & Create

TASK 01:</> WRITE A PROGRAM TO PRINT A NUMERIC
VALUE

Program Step 1:-

Create a variable name it as "A"

Program Step 2:-

Initialize the "A" variable

Program Step 3:-

Store an int block to specify that input will be stored value

Program Step 4:-

Connect print variable block for print the variable

Program Step 5:-

Add the ‘A' value block to print blocks

Output

Apply & Create

TASK 02:</> WRITE A PROGRAM TO PRINT A
CHARACTER

Program Step 1:-

Create a variable name it as "A"

Program Step 2:-

Initialize the "A" variable

Program Step 3:-

Store an int block to specify that input will be stored
character with “double quotation marks”

Program Step 4:-

Connect print variable block for print the variable

Program Step 5:-

Add the ‘A' value block to print blocks

Output

Apply & Create

TASK 03:</> WRITE A PROGRAM TO CHANGE THE DATA
TYPE OF THE VARIABLE

INTEGER
❑

They are often called just integers or ints, are positive or negative whole numbers with
no decimal point.

Program

Note: Only the numeric value will change to integer.
we can not change an alphabet into integer

Output

Apply & Create

TASK 04:</> WRITE A PROGRAM TO CHANGE THE DATA
TYPE OF THE VARIABLE

Program

This command allows you to take input and data from
the user to perform certain operation during output

Output

Apply & Create

TASK 05:</> WRITE A PROGRAM TO DISPLAY YOUR
DETAILS LIKE NAME,AGE,SCHOOL NAME IN
THREE DIFFERENT LINES

Program

Output

Apply & Create

TASK 06:</> WRITE A PROGRAM TO SAVE THE NUMERIC
INPUT VALUE FROM USER TO A VARIABLE.

Program

Output
