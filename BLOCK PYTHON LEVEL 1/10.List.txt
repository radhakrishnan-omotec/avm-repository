Understanding

LISTS

Python offers a range of compound datatypes often referred to as sequences. List is
one of the most frequently used and very versatile datatype used in Python.
In Python programming, a list is created by placing all the items (elements) inside a
square bracket [ ], separated by commas.
It can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float,
string etc.).

LIST INDEX
List Index
We can use the index operator [] to access an item in a list. Index starts from 0. So,
a list having 5 elements will have index from 0 to 4.
Trying to access an element other that this will raise an IndexError. The index must
be an integer. We can't use float or other types; this will result into TypeError.

Nested List: A list can even have another list as an item. This is called nested list

INDEXING AND NEGATIVE INDEXING
Negative indexing: Python allows negative indexing for its sequences. The index of -1
refers to the last item, -2 to the second last item and so on.
+ INDEXING

- INDEXING

LIST OPERATIONS
Append: Add the element in the end of the list

Insert: Add the element at the specific position in the
list, E.g. adding 5 at pose 2

Extend: Add another list in the list

Pop: Remove element from specific position

Remove: Remove element from list at it’s 1st occurrence.
