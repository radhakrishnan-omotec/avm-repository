SESSION - 11
VOTING MACHINE

Learning Outcomes:
●
●

Remember: The students will list different ways in which we can store, update values in a

variable .
Understand: - They will focus on understanding the execution of the program by the use of
IF-ELSE STRUCTURE
- They will understand how to compare and perform operations on stored values .

●

Apply: They will apply the concepts learnt to the code of Voting Machine Program .

●

Analyze: They will check their understanding by developing the codes

●

Create: They will create the code in EduBlocks

Remember &
Understanding

ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION

In this activity we are creating a code for voting machine.
