SESSION - 5
CALCULATOR

Learning Outcomes:
● Remember: The students will list different types of blocks being learnt in the session .
● Understand: - They will focus on understanding the conditional statement - IF-ELSE
- They will also learn more about arithmetic operators

● Apply: They will apply If-else structure to build a calculator
● Analyze: They will check their understanding by developing a code.
● Create: They will create the code in EduBlocks

Remember &
Understanding

CALCULATOR

• In this activity we have to design a basic calculator using basic arithmetic
operations.

• Make a program to add, subtract, multiply, divide and find reminder
• Let the student try to make code by himself/herself.
• Take user input as 1st and second number
• Select an option what to do Add, Sub, Mul, Div

Apply & Create

TASK 01:</> WRITE A PROGRAM TO MAKE A
CALCULATOR

Program Step 1:-

Create a variable and name it as ‘A’

Program Step 2:-

Initialize the "A" variable

Program Step 3:-

Store an int block to specify that input will be
stored as an integer

Program Step 4:-

Add an input block to take input from the user

Program Step 5:-

Create another variable with name 'B' the same way to store the second number

Program Step 6:Add a print "Hello World" block and change the
"Hello World" with the operation names that
calculator can perform

Program Step 7:Create another variable 'I' to store the operation
user wants the calculator to perform

Program Step 8:Add an input block to take input from the user
for the operation user wants to do

Program Step 9:Add if statement from the logic block

Program Step 10:-

Program Step 11:Add equal to from the logic block

Program Step 12:-

Program Step 13:-

Add the 'I' value block from the variables to the left of the comparison block to compare
the input given by user

Program Step 14:Take the print “Hello World” block from the
statement

Program Step 15:-

Program Step 16:Take the int block from the statement

Program Step 17:-

Program Step 18:The same
way make
the code for
all the
other three
operations

Program Step 19:Take the Else block from the logic

Program Step 20:-

Program Step :-

Output

ACTIVITY SHEETS

Question 3:
How do we add values of two variables?

A. A+=B
B. A+B
C. A++
D. A=+

Question 4:
Which statement is correct?

A. if x=10:
B. if x==10:
C. if x+=10:
D. if x>=10:

Question 5:
If we want the code to behave in a way that if one condition
isn’t correct it should follow the other command, what do we
do?
A. add an else condition
B. add an if else condition
C. add elif condition
D. add while loop
