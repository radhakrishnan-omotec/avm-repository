SESSION - 8
PRIME NUMBER

Learning Outcomes:
●

Remember: The students will list different types of blocks being learnt in the session .

●

Understand: - They will focus on understanding the FOR Loop

●

Apply: - They will apply FOR loop to check if a number is Prime or not
- Will use a combination of IF-ELSE and FOR loop to execute programs .
- Apply the use of BREAK statement

●

Analyze: They will check their understanding by developing a code.

●

Create: They will create the code in EduBlocks

Apply & Create

ACTIVITY DESCRIPTION

• A 'for loop' is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a
dictionary, a set, or a string).
• In this activity we are going to use for loop and else for loop also
• Example:for i in range(2, num):
if num % i == 0:
print("It is not a prime Number")
break

else:
print("It is a prime Number")

Program Step 1:-

Get a While loop to make the code run repeatedly

Program Step 2:-

Create a variable with name 'num' to store input from
the user

Program Step 3:-

Add an int block to convert the input given by user
into an integer

Program Step 4:-

Add an input block to the int block to get input from
user

Program Step 5:-

Add an if condition from the logic

Program Step 6:-

Add a comparison block and change it to greater than
block to check if the input given by the user is greater
than 1

Program Step 7:Get the num variable block and connect it to the left
side of comparison block and write 1 on the right side

Program Step 8:Get a for loop connect it inside the if
condition and set the range to 2, num,
so that it will check ever number
between 2 to number given by user

Program Step 9:-

Program Step 10:-

Add an if condition inside for loop

Program Step 11:Add a comparison block to the if
condition

Program Step 12:-

Program Step 13:-

Get the addition block from math drawer and change
it to modulus

Program Step 14:Get the num
variable block
and connect it
to the left side
of modulus
and write I on
the right side,
this will give us
the remainder,
if the
remainder is
equal to 0, it is
not a prime
number

Program Step 15:Add a print "Hello World" block inside if
condition, so that if the number given by user is
divisible by any smaller number, then it will
print "it is not a prime number"

Program Step 16:-

Program Step 17:Add a break block below print, so if the number
is divisible, after printing it will break the loop

Program Step 18:-

Program Step 19:Connect an else block beneath for loop, if the
number is not divisible by any number, then it
should print it is a prime number

Program Step 20:-

Program Step 21:Add a print "Hello World" block inside else
condition, so that if the number given by user is
not divisible by any smaller number, then it will
print "it is a prime number"

Program Step 22:-
