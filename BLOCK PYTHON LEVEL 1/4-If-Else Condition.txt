SESSION - 4
IF-ELSE CONDITION

Learning Outcomes:
● Remember: The students will list different types of blocks being learnt in the session .
● Understand: - They will focus on understanding the conditional statement - IF-ELSE
● Apply: They will learn to apply and check the execution of the learnt statement

● Analyze: They will check their understanding by developing a code.
● Create: They will create the code in EduBlocks

Remember & Understanding

CONDITIONS

If and else statement is basically used to compare the condition, then perform one task
out of two.
For example, if we want to make program to identify whether you are minor by age or
not then we use if statement to compare the age.

TYPES OF CONDITIONS

Types of conditions

If-then
block

If-else
block

If-else if
block

IF-THEN BLOCK
⮚ If statement is the simplest decision-making statement.
⮚ It is used to decide whether a certain statement or block of statements will
be executed or not
⮚ i.e. if a certain condition is true then a block of statement is executed
otherwise not.

IF-ELSE BLOCK
⮚ A user can decide among multiple options. The if statements are executed
from the top down.
⮚ As soon as one of the conditions controlling the if is true, the statement
associated with that if is executed, and the rest of the ladder is bypassed.
⮚ If none of the conditions is true, then the final else statement will be
executed.

TASK 01:</> WRITE A PROGRAM TO COMPARE TWO
GIVEN NUMBERS

Program Step 1:-

Create a variable and name it as ‘A’

Program Step 2:-

Initialize the "A" variable

Program Step 3:-

Store an int block to specify that input will be
stored as an integer

Program Step 4:-

Add an input block to take input from the user

Program Step 5:-

Create another variable with name 'B' the same way to store the second number

Program Step 6:Add an 'if' condition

Program Step 7:-

Add a comparison block to the 'if condition' to check what
operation has user chosen

Program Step 8:-

Add the ‘A' value block to the left of the comparison block to compare the input
given by user.
Add the ‘B' value block to the right of the comparison block to compare the
input given by user

Program Step 9:Connect print "Hello World" block and change the
text to “Both A and B are equal"

Program Step 10:Take a ‘Else’ block from the Logic

Program Step 11:-

Program Step 12:Take a print
hello world
from the
statement and
connect it with
else block and
write both
numbers are
not equal
