Remember: The students will list different types of Logic Gates

●

Understand: - They will focus on understanding the working and application of different logic

gates .
●

Apply: They will learn how to apply different logical operations

●

Analyze: They will check their understanding by developing a code.

●

Create: They will create the code in EduBlocks

Remember &
Understanding

AND LOGICAL OPERATOR

For AND operator – It returns TRUE if both the operands (right side and left
side) are true

OR LOGICAL OPERATOR

For OR operator- It returns TRUE if either of the operand (right side or
left side) is true

NOT LOGICAL OPERATOR

For NOT operator- returns TRUE if operand is false

Apply & Create

Program Step 1:-

Create a variable with name 'A' to store input from
the user

Program Step 2:-

Create a variable with name 'B' to store input from the
user

Program Step 3:-

Take the varibale ‘A’ and store the data TRUE

Program Step 4:-

Take the varibale ‘B’ and store the data FALSE

Program Step 5:-

Take the print variable block from the statement

Program Step 6:-

Take ‘and’ block from the logical operator

Program Step 7:-

Program Step 8:Get a for loop connect it inside the if
condition and set the range to 2, num,
so that it will check ever number
between 2 to number given by user

Program Step 9:-

Program Step 10:-

FINAL CODE

Program Step 1:-

Program Step 2:-

Program Step 3:-

Program Step 4:-
