Learning Outcomes:
● Remember: The students will list different types of blocks being learnt in the session .
● Understand: - They will focus on understanding different arithmetic operators
● Apply: They will learn to apply and check the execution of the learnt operators
● Analyze: They will check their understanding by developing a code to check calculations
● Create: They will create the code in EduBlocks

Remember &
Understanding

ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS

❑ Operators are special symbols in Python that carry out arithmetic or logical computation
❑ Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical
operations:
⮚ Addition
⮚ Subtraction
⮚ Multiplication
⮚ Division
⮚ Modules

TYPES OF ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS

Addition

Subtracti
on

Division

Multiplic
ation

Remainder

Apply & Create

TASK 01:</> WRITE A PROGRAM TO SUM OF TWO DIGIT
NUMBER

Program Step 1:-

For printing output take a print variable block

Program Step 2:-

Stack the print “Addition” block inside the print
variable block to print

Program Step 3:The same way make the code
for all the other three
operations

Output

Apply & Create

TASK 02:</> WRITE A PROGRAM SUM THE DIGITS OF THE
GIVEN NUMBER

Program Step 1:-

Create a variable name it as "FIRST NUMBER"

Program Step 2:-

Create a one more variable for Second number and
name it as “SECOND NUMBER"

Program Step 3:Initialize the “First number" variable

Program Step 4:-

Store an int block to specify that input will be
stored as an integer

Program Step 5:-

Add an input block to take input from the user

Program Step 6:-

Create another variable with name 'SECOND
NUMBER' the same way to store the second number

Program Step 7:Connect print"Hello World" block and change the text
to "Sum is"

Program Step 8:Stack the print variable block and change the variable
to(First number + Second number), this block will add
the values stored in variables First number and
Second number and print the result
